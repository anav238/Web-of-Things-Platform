      <p>
        This technical report presents the technical aspects regarding the implementation of the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a> platform
        project done for the <span typeof="schema:Course" resource="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/wade/"><a href="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/wade/"> 
          <span property="schema:name">Web Application Development</span>
          course</a></span>. The project consists of a Web application that allows
        its users to manage their own smart homes by adding smart devices to the homes, interacting with the smart devices and
        adding other users to the home.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        We developed the application using the REST paradigm, and the communication between the client (the front-end of the
        application) and the server (the back-end application) is done through a REST API. We made this design choice
        because the REST paradigm "enforces the separation of concerns and helps the client and the server components evolve
        independently" (<span typeof="schema:WebSite" resource="https://restfulapi.net/"><a role="doc-biblioref" href="https://restfulapi.net/"><span property="schema:name">Restful API website</span></a></span>), which is a general
        development good practice that helped us better organize inside the team.

      <h2>Use cases</h2>
      <p>
        The use cases that are covered in our application are the ones presented in the following use case diagram:

        In the following sections, we will present more details regarding the implementation of this solution.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="internal-data-structures">
      <h2>Internal data structures/models</h2>
      <p>
        The resources that are used inside our Web application are: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Users - at the root of the application, we have the application users, having their associated credentials that they 
          need to use for accessing the application. Besides credentials and other user information,
          an application user will have associated a number of homes, inside which he will have a specific role: 
        </li>
       <li>
        Homes - a home will contain a list of smart objects with associated categories and a list of members 
        (application users) with associated roles (either Owner, Member, Child or Guest). 
       </li>
       <li>
        Smart devices - each smart object will be stored with the relevant data obtained from its WoT specification. This is useful since
        we have easy access to the object’s properties and action.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Owner of a home will be able to group the smart devices inside the home in the following categories:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Entertainment - for objects like televisions or smart speakers. Entertainment objects will be accessible for all roles inside a home, including guests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Environment - objects like smart bulbs, blinds, humidifiers, fans, air conditioners or different sensors related to the
          environment. These will be accessible for all roles except guests, so only permanent members of a household can control
          the environment
        </li>
        <li>
          Security - objects like security cameras, lockers, wall plugs. Only the Owner of the home and the Members of the home
          (excluding children) will be able to access these types of objects.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Other permissions related to each role inside the smart home are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Owner - can manage the home and its linked smart objects. Can add new smart objects or remove existing ones and do any
          supported operation. Can invite new members, children or guests inside the home.
        </li>
        <li>
          Member - can interact with all objects inside the home. Can invite new guests inside the home
        </li>
        <li>
          Child - can only interact with specific categories of objects inside the home
        </li>
        <li>
          Guest - same as child, but access to objects is only granted for a limited period of time, set by the owner
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <p>
      The resources presented previously are accessible through the REST API, by making a GET request to the website’s
      endpoint /{resourceName}/{resourceIdentifier}. Before fetching the resource, the server first checks if the user has the
      necessary permissions to access that request. The responses of the REST API will always be JSON-LD objects, offering 
      context to each mapped field of the returned resource. Each API Call made by the front-end application (except the ones for 
      registering a new user and retrieving an existing user's access token) is 
      authenticated using an authorization token that will also be used to determine if the requester has the necessary rights to perform that
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the architecture of the application, we use a layered approach. The presentation layer, which is the
      front-end of the application, communicates with the business layer, which is the API of the application. The
      business layer handles checking the permissions of the user for which the API Calls are made, using utilitary functions for 
      communicating with the database, and making API Calls to the smart devices, in order to
      interact with them. The utilitary functions contain the SPARQL query logic, which communicate with the TDB database 
      using Apache Jena.
    </p>

      <h2>Mozilla WebThings Framework</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, in order to simulate the IoTs adopting the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description">WoT
          Thing Description specification</a>, we are using
          <span typeof="schema:SoftwareApplication" resource="https://webthings.io/framework/"><a href="https://webthings.io/framework/">
            <span property="schema:name">Mozilla WebThings Framework</span></a></span>. According to the project’s official webpage:
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="https://webthings.io/framework/">
        The WebThings Framework is a collection of
        reusable software components to help you build your own web things, which directly expose the <span typeof="schema:SoftwareApplication" resource="https://webthings.io/api/"><a
          href="https://webthings.io/api/"><span property="schema:name">Web Thing API</span></a></span>. This means
        they can be discovered by a Web of Things gateway or client, which can then automatically detect the device's
        capabilities and monitor and control it over the web.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        These IoTs are built in a server separate from the main Web Application. This server exposes different endpoints
        for each object, respecting the Web Thing API specification for that specific object. For the WebThings server, 
        we use the <span typeof="schema:SoftwareSourceCode" resource="https://github.com/WebThingsIO/webthing-python">
        <a href="https://github.com/WebThingsIO/webthing-python"><span property="schema:name">official code example for the framework</span></a></span>
        containing a lamp and a humidity sensor.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using the URL of a smart device's WoT specification, a user will be able to save the new device in the 
        application and then add it to his home. Adding a device to his home offers offer him the
        possibility to see the object’s properties and perform the supported actions on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The WoT descriptions of the objects are stored in the application's database, so that the user can easily control
        his linked smart devices. The back-end server then makes API calls to interact with the smart objects by using the
        base URL and constructing the endpoints for properties and actions using the base link and their names.
      </p>
  </section>
  <section id="linked-data-principles">
    <h2>Linked Data Principles</h2>
    <p>
      This application adheres to the linked data principles as each resource has a unique HTTP URI (represented by the REST
      API endpoint /{resourceType}/{resourceIdentifier}, which returns relevant information about that resource in the JSON-LD
      format, containing data for discovering other linked resources. The JSON-LD responses also contain information about the 
      context of each property, so that crawlers can also understand their meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      For expressing these properties, we used the following vocabularies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>VCARD and VCARD4 - used for Users and Homes, we chose to use these because of the built-in support for those 
      vocabularies in Apache Jena. They are built specifically for persons and organisations, so they had useful properties 
      for modelling these two entities.</li>
      <li>Thing Description (TD) Ontology - built specifically by the Web Consortium for Web things, so it is very expressive for 
      storing information about the smart devices from their WoT specifications </li>
      <li>JSON Schema - used for expressing smart device properties and action inputs, also expressive as it is created for the 
      specific purpose of describing JSON schemas.</li> 
      <li>Schema.org - used for expressing properties that we did not find in the other vocabularies - this is not as expressive 
      as the others, but it contains a huge variety of properties where we could find the missing pieces from our data.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="data-storage">
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      At first, we wanted to use <span typeof="schema:SoftwareApplication" resource="https://brightstardb.com/">
      <a href="https://brightstardb.com/"><span property="schema:name">BrightstarDB</span></a></span> for storing the data,
      but we had issues configuring it in our project and we switched to Apache Jena, which is free, open-source and well-documented.
      Apache Jena offered us TDB, which, according to their website, is a native high performance triple store, and the RDF API, 
      which enabled us to easily work with resources inside the model and perform various SPARQL queries on the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important interrogations that are used inside the applications are finding all homes linked to a user,
      all users that have a role inside a home, all smart devices inside a home and all properties and actions applicable to a
      smart device. The SPARQL queries are done in the back-end, so that the front-end does not need to handle the logic
      of building and executing these queries. The results of the SPARQL queries are also be parsed in the back-end so the
      REST API will return the responses structured in a way that will require less processing on the front-end side.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="frontend-solution">
    <h2>Frontend solution</h2>
  </section>
  <section id="backend-solution">
    <h2>Backend solution</h2>
    <figure typeof="sa:image">
      <img src="../diagrams/ClassDiagram.drawio.png">
    </figure>
    <p>
      The backend application is a Spring server with three controllers, corresponding to the three main resources of the 
      application. At the server startup, the application establishes the connection with the TDB triple-store, which is then
      used throughout the application for persistence. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Each controller contains the main logic for all the different endpoints it 
      exposes, and uses some utilitary classes in order to perform the different SPARQL queries needed for reading the data from the 
      database, and then processing the data so it's mapped to the internal models used in the application. In order to enrich those 
      models with semantic information and respond with proper JSON-LD files, we use the Jackson-Jsonld Java library, which 
      enables us to add annotations inside the models for expressing the context for the attributes, and then to serialize 
      them in JSON-LD format.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more complex SPARQL query that is used for fetching details about a device with a given id is built in the following code snippet: 
    </p>
    <figure typeof="schema:SoftwareSourceCode">
      <pre>
        <code>
String queryString = VocabularyConstants.VCARD_PREFIX + " " +
"SELECT ?title ?description ?property ?action ?baseLink ?category " +
"WHERE { ?device  vcard:CLASS \"DEVICE\" . " +
"?device vcard:UID \"" + id + "\" . " +
"?device <" + WOT.DESCRIPTION + "> ?description . " +
"?device <" + WOT.TITLE + "> ?title . " +
"OPTIONAL { ?device vcard:CATEGORIES ?category } " +
"OPTIONAL { ?device <" + WOT.HAS_LINK + "> ?baseLink } " +
"OPTIONAL { ?device <" + WOT.HAS_PROPERTY_AFFORDANCE + "> ?property } " +
"OPTIONAL { ?device <" + WOT.HAS_ACTION_AFFORDANCE + "> ?action } " +
"}";
        </code>
      </pre>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Here we fetch all necessary data regarding a device by selecting all its properties, either literals or resources, 
      using the relationships that were used when posting that device. There are four optional fields that do not depend on each other, 
      meaning category, baseLink, property and action. They belong to separate OPTIONAL bodies since the absence of one of them does not 
      mean that we don't want to fetch the other data.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are also using constants for fetching URLS of vocabularies and properties, so that they are easy to change if the vocabulary is 
      updated or we decide to use a different approach for expressing one of the relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Updating a resource is done through PATCH operations and is only possible for Users and Homes. In order to implement 
      the PATCH operations, we use the Java library json-patch, which processes the standard operations for patching an object. 
      After obtaining the patched object, we use an utilitary function (either from the class UserResourceUpdater or HomeResourceUpdater) 
      to observe the differences between the old object and the patched object, and then to modify the corresponding triples inside 
      the triple-store - which is done by deleting the old triples and adding new ones with the updated values.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example of building a delete query that is used for updating the user's inside a home is the following:
    </p>
    <figure typeof="schema:SoftwareSourceCode">
      <pre>
        <code>
String deleteQueryString = VocabularyConstants.VCARD_PREFIX + " " +
VocabularyConstants.VCARD4_PREFIX + " " +
"DELETE { ?blank_node vcard:UID ?userId . " +
"?blank_node vcard:CLASS ?userRole . " +
"?home vcard4:hasMember ?blank_node " +
"} WHERE { ?home vcard4:hasMember ?blank_node . " +
"?home vcard:UID \"" + oldHome.getId() + "\"} ";
        </code>
      </pre>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Here we delete all three statements related to a user's relationship with a house: the hasMember relationship that is 
      tied to a blank node and the two statements that are tied to the blank node, one related to the id of the user of the home 
      and the other one related to the role of the user in that home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deleting a resource is done through the Apache Jena RDF API, by deleting all the statements inside the triple-store 
      that contain the given resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication with a smart device is done for multiple endpoints:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All endpoints where we fetch details about the smart device - there we also fetch the current values for 
        each property of the smart device 
      </li>
      <li>
        The endpoint for executing an action in a smart device - there we post the payload received to the 
        corresponding endpoint of the smart device and then pass-through the response we receive from the smart device
      </li>
    </ul>
